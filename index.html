        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Christian Norton and I'm a senior at Murray State University studying computer science. I'm a
            passionate and hard-working student that loves to problem solve with programming. I find that solving
            challenging
            problems gives me a sense of reward and accomplishment at the end of the day. Programming has always
            been a way
            for me to express the creativity in my mind. During my free time, I usually enjoy to read fantasy books,
            workout,
            watch movies, and relax with my family.
